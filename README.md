## TeXBoT
This is a simple bot for Telegram written in Java using the long polling technique. In other words, the bot will periodically request updates from Telegram, enabling any computer with Java installed and an internet connection to run the bot so that there is no need for a web server. However, if you already have one, you may be interested in a [simpler](https://github.com/AndreaLu/PTeXBoT) solution.

The main functionality of the bot is to send elegant mathematical expressions as stickers.
